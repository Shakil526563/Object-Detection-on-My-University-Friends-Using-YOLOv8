For this project, I worked on detecting my three university friends and myself using YOLOv8. I annotated a small dataset of approximately 40 images with the Roboflow platform and explored various YOLOv8 models. Due to the limited number of images, the model performance was not ideal. Despite this, I observed some promising results and gained valuable experience in customizing object detection models with small datasets.
